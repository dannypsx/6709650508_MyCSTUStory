                        <p>
                            In my first year, I focused on understanding the basics of programming and improving my math
                            skills. I worked on simple applications and learned how to collaborate through small group
                            projects, which helped me build communication and teamwork abilities.

                    Year 2
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second year was more challenging but rewarding. I developed a deeper understanding of software
                    design, problem-solving, and working with tools like Git and Cloud Computing. Small team projects
                    helped me apply my growing technical knowledge and understand more complex data structures.

                </p>
                <p>
                    By the third year, I applied my skills in real-world projects and gained practical experience
                    through an internship. I explored areas like AI and Data Science, while also developing soft skills
                    such as presenting, teamwork, and time management. This year gave me a solid grasp of working in
                    tech environments.

                            In my final year, I worked on more advanced projects, using all the knowledge Iâ€™d gained. My
                            understanding of system architecture and complex problem-solving deepened as I tackled
                            real-world
                            challenges in team settings, preparing me for the next step in my career.
