                        <p>
                            I envision myself becoming a skilled software developer with
                            expertise in modern
                            technologies.

                        <p>
                            I want to contribute to creating innovations that can genuinely improve people's
                            lives,whether
                            it's
                            through
                            developing applications or software that facilitate everyday tasks.

                    The second year was more challenging but rewarding. I developed a deeper understanding of software
                    design, problem-solving, and working with tools like Git and Cloud Computing. Small team projects
                    helped me apply my growing technical knowledge and understand more complex data structures.

                    By the third year, I applied my skills in real-world projects and gained practical experience
                    through an internship. I explored areas like AI and Data Science, while also developing soft skills
                    such as presenting, teamwork, and time management. This year gave me a solid grasp of working in
                    tech environments.

                            In my final year, I worked on more advanced projects, using all the knowledge Iâ€™d gained. My
                            understanding of system architecture and complex problem-solving deepened as I tackled
                            real-world
                            challenges in team settings, preparing me for the next step in my career.
