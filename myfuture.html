                            I’m committed to mastering the key areas of computer science, whether it’s programming, data
                            handling, or creating efficient systems.
                        </p>

                            I love the challenges that come with writing code and solving complex problems.

                    I want to use my knowledge to create solutions that make a real difference in people’s lives.
                    Whether it's developing apps that improve everyday life or working on projects that tackle global
                    challenges, I believe technology has the power to bring positive change, and I want to be a part of

                    I see myself working for leading tech companies or even starting my own business in the future. I
