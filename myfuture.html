    From my perspective, I envision myself becoming a skilled software developer with expertise in modern technologies.
    I want to contribute to creating innovations that can genuinely improve people's lives, whether it's through
    developing applications or software that facilitate everyday tasks.

    Additionally, I see myself working in a company that fosters an open and collaborative work environment, promoting
    continuous learning and development. I want to learn from experienced colleagues while sharing knowledge with my
    peers so that we can all grow together.

    Ultimately, I hope that my work will have a positive impact on society and inspire younger generations to pursue
    careers in technology. Being involved in projects that carry meaningful significance will give my life purpose and
    clarity of goals.
