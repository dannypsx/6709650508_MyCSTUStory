                <p><strong>Year 1</strong> </p>
                <p>In my first year, I focused on understanding the basics of programming and improving my math skills.
                    I worked on simple applications and learned how to collaborate through small group projects, which
                    helped me build communication and teamwork abilities.

                <p>Year 2</p>
                <p>The second year was more challenging but rewarding. I developed a deeper understanding of software
                    design, problem-solving, and working with tools like Git and Cloud Computing. Small team projects
                    helped me apply my growing technical knowledge and understand more complex data structures.

                    through an internship. I explored areas like AI and Data Science, while also developing soft skills
                    such as presenting, teamwork, and time management. This year gave me a solid grasp of working in
                    tech environments.
