            <h1><strong>Year 1 </strong></h1>

            <p>
                In my first year, I focused on understanding the basics of programming and improving my math
                skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked on simple applications and learned how to collaborate through small group
                projects, which helped me build communication and teamwork abilities.

            <h1><strong>Year 2</strong></h1>
            <p>
                The second year was more challenging but rewarding. I developed a deeper understanding of software
                design, problem-solving, and working with tools like Git and Cloud Computing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Small team projects helped me apply my growing technical knowledge and understand more complex data
                structures.

            <h1><strong> Year 3</strong></h1>
            <p>
                By the third year, I applied my skills in real-world projects and gained practical experience
                through an internship.
            </p>
            <p>
                I explored areas like AI and Data Science, while also developing soft skills
                such as presenting, teamwork, and time management.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year gave me a solid grasp of working in
                tech environments.

                <h1><strong>Year 4</strong></h1>
                <p> 
                    In my final year, I worked on more advanced projects, using all the knowledge I’d gained. My
                    understanding of system architecture and complex problem-solving deepened as I tackled
                    real-world
                    challenges in team settings, preparing me for the next step in my career.
